# A simple setup for i3wm and some tools basesd on [Stock EndeavourOS config for i3](https://github.com/endeavouros-team/endeavouros-i3wm-setup).

Heyy! Welcome to my github page.
These are my dotfiles for i3. This is still a work in progress. I'm fairly new to both i3wm and GitHub, so if you spot something that can be improved or fixed, feel free to open an issue or suggest a change!

I'm using this on EndeavourOS, if it matters.
Note: My pc cannot handle blur so I'm using transparancy effects.

#### Dependencies

- [i3 WM](https://i3wm.org/) - For window manager
- [Picom FL-Labs fork](https://github.com/FT-Labs/picom) - For blur and transparency
- [Rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) - App launcher
- [i3blocks](https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks) - top bar

I've also included some cursor themes. I'm currently using [Afterglow cursors](https://github.com/yeyushengfan258/Afterglow-Cursors).
